	"description": "The F-80 is a yacht manufatured by the ISF Shipyards. Most of these vessels can be found in the rich coreworlds, where it's popular for being a cheaper ISF design while still being plenty luxurious. On these worlds, it's commonly used for racing, short-range transport, and of course partying. In the Frontier however, the F-80s are most often used for sport hunting. The Frontier variants are usually modified with living quarters for a member of Saint-Roumain Militia who acts as a guide in the most dangerous of environments. Regardless of the variant and where it's found, the F-80 is the best choice for those who want the best of life.",
